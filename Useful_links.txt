Some useful links for new R programmers:

Download and install R from here:
https://www.r-project.org/

Download and install an IDE (integrated development enviroment), either RStudio:
https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

or RKWard:
https://rkward.kde.org/

or simply use a code editor like Notepad++:
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

or any other code editor with syntax highlighting

or (new!) go to:
https://ide.flexpilot.ai
This is a modern IDE with AI/LLM integration using GPT-4o.

R is a highly modular statistical programming language. That means it can be extended by packages, which are basically a set of custom functions along with function descriptions and (sometimes) data sets and usage examples (vignettes).

For an overview of R packages sorted by topic, see:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/

For a list of all R packages ever published, with a very short (one sentence) description, see:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html

For one of the countless introductions into R, see (for example):
https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/

For questions, you can ask me, of course. Or use one of the following links to LLMs:
https://chatgpt.com/ (nothing new, unless you lived in a cage for the past years)
https://chat.mistral.ai/chat (French LLM)
https://copilot.microsoft.com/ (Microsoft Copilot)
https://toolbaz.com/writer/chat-gpt-alternative (many different LLMs, but "one-shot" only, no real conversations)
https://huggingface.co/ (search for Qwen Coder. Available in different sizes. The newer ones (like Qwen3 Coder 30B-A3B) are very "heavy" (require at least 16 GB RAM and a fast CPU). The older model (Qwen2.5 Coder) is available in various sizes, from 1.5 over 7 to 14 billion parameters. Start with the smallest one and try if larger ones also work reasonably fast on your computer. Use a "moderately quantized" version like Q4_K_M.
