I uploaded a zip file containing a virtual machine (Debian 13) with R, R Markdown and LaTeX preinstalled (Debian 13+R+markdown+tinytex.7z).
It contains everything you need to run analyses and compile Rmd files to pdf.
You can find (and download) it here: https://www.swisstransfer.com/d/61cc9943-a0b4-4f6a-bb0f-90d2e5b99cad or here: https://1drv.ms/u/c/45cdef155262859c/IQBSUIbbfAM4SZl0hQQdkuNdATa76VBeb-97WP5j9P3bG3I?e=Aza8JL
Pros: relatively small size, low hardware requirements (RAM, storage, CPU), "no frills", you will learn a bit how to work with the console in linux.
Drawback: It is not user-friendly at all. Once the virtual machine (VM) booted, you will only see a black screen. Press the left and right mouse key at the same time to open a menu from which you can start a text editor (mousepad) and R.
This is the "last resort" solution if you have a very old computer with very little RAM.
Note: You might get an error when trying to start the virtual machine (VM). If so, close/shut down the vM,  right-click on "Current state", click on remove current state (or similar), try to start it again. You should now see a black screen asking for a username (ibe) and password (ibe).

For a more user-friedly solution, I did the same again in a virtual machine based on Lubuntu 24.03.3.
You can find (and download) it here: https://tinyurl.com/4rkupcne or here: https://onedrive.live.com/?redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3UvYy80NWNkZWYxNTUyNjI4NTljL0lRQ3hQZXhyOWJPOFNxenltbzRnTEJzVEFiYkpERWxTNlF5ZGdaaTZ0M3hzdWF3P2U9aVVDdW9I
Pros: Much easier to use. (Graphical interface, similar to Windows.)
Cons: Considerably larger, thus more RAM and storage required (and a faster CPU), takes longer to boot.
Instruction (how to use it):
- Install VirtualBox from here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- Double-click on the vbox file. It should now appear as machine in VirtualBox.
- If you want, change some parameteres of the virtual machine, like the amount of RAM allocated to it. To do so, click Modify -> change the allocated memory to e.g. 8192 MB. (Please don't allocate more than maybe 60% of your available memory.)
- Click Run.

Keep the zip file in case you accidently delete the vbox or the vdi file!

You will be asked for a username and password to log in to the VM.
username: ibe
password: ibe

Once the VM started (which might take a while), you will find on the desktop or in the start menu:
- R 4.3.3 (console version),
- a very simple code editor (Geany or Mousepad in the smaller or larger VM, respectively),
- RStudio*,
- Firefox*,
- a very simple file manager (type nnn in the console/Terminal emulator).
- In /home/ibe/Downloads you will find a csv file with a data set.
*Only in the "heavier" Lubuntu VM.

Recommended work flow:
- Open RStudio (double click on the desktop icon),
- click "Execute" when asked (to start the program),
- Import the data set, create an R Markdown document, do your analyses, compile your document to PDF etc.

R Markdown is pre-installed, together with a range of other packages (dependencies).

Not necessary for the data project, but not a bad idea either:
Update the operating system and its installed programs (packages). 
- Click start (bird symbol on the bottom-left) -> Preferences -> Lubuntu Update.
- Click Check for Updates -> enter the password (ibe) -> click OK.
- Click Install Updates -> enter the password (ibe) -> click OK.
- Click Close when finished.

To install other applications (which is not necessary for the data project) in the Lubuntu VM, open the console (Start -> System Tools -> QTerminal) and type this:
sudo apt update
ibe
sudo apt install <name of the package>.

In the Debian VM, start the terminal emulator by right-clicking on the desktop and opening it. The commands are then the same as in Lubuntu.

Recommendation: Start with
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install synaptic
Press Y
Close the console.
This installs a program with which you can install other programs without using the console.

Open Synaptic from the start menu. (Start -> Preferences -> Synaptic Package Manager)
type ibe and press OK.
Read the "Introduction", then close it.
Click search and type the name of a program of your choice (e.g. abiword for a simple word processor).
Click on the check box for abiword and select "Mark for installation").
Click "Mark".
Click "Apply".
Click "Apply" again.
Click Close.
Close the Synaptic Package Manager.
You should find the installed application in the start menu.
If you want to have a shortcut on the desktop: Right click -> Add to Desktop.
