#ifelse() is easier/less code to write if you want only two categories (dichotomization). If you have three or more categories, I would recommend conditional subsetting like the definition of the variables "married_man" etc. from above.

#Income stratified by Gender and marital status:

tapply(datc$Income, list(datc$Gender, datc$Married), FUN=median)

#Mode: Strangely, there is no built-in function in R to calculate the mode. But we can write one:
find_mode <- function(x) {
  u <- unique(x)
  tab <- tabulate(match(x, u))
  u[tab == max(tab)]
}
find_mode(datc$Cards)
table(datc$Cards)
# In the following, I "decomposed" the function to explain the individual calculation steps of the function.
x <- datc$Cards #This is just so that we can work with an object "x" and don't need to write datc$Cards every time.
u <- unique(x) #unique(datc$Cards) returns the different possible values of the variable, in the order in which they first appear in the data set. (You could get the same - but in another data type (character) with names(table(datc$Cards)).)
x_u_matched <- match(x, u) #match() returns the position at which it finds the values of x in u. The first 5 elements of x are 2, 3, 4, 3, 2. in u (2, 3, 4, 5, 1), those are the positions 1, 2, 3, 2, 1. "5" occurs for the first time in the 9th value of x. It is the 4th value of u. So the 9th value of match(x, u) is 4. Every other "5" in the vector x will also get the value 4 as outcome of match(x, u).
tab <- tabulate(x_u_matched) #tabulate() counts the number of times each integer occurs in a vector. You could also use as.numeric(table(x_u_matched)).
u[tab == max(tab)] #max(tab) returns the maximum of tab, i.e. the value of tabulate(x_u_matched) with the most counts / which occurs most frequently. tab == max(tab) returns TRUE for the largest value (maximum), i.e. for the value with the most occurances, and FALSE for all other values. And finally, u[tab == max(tab)] subsets the vector u (the possible values) with the position that returns TRUE, i.e. the most frequent value. And this is the definition of the mode of a vector.


#Chi-squared test:
mytab <- table(datc$Income_factor, datc$Married)
chisq.test(mytab)

#anova:
logreg2 <- glm(Married ~ Income + Education + Cards, data=datc, family="binomial")
anova(logreg, logreg2) #Note that anova() for model comparison is only valid in case of nested models. I.e. you use the same data, the same response variable, and model 1 contains all the variables that are included in model 2, but model 2 has one or more further variables. (I.e. the smaller model is a true subset of the larger model.) If this is not the case, R will still produce an output and a p value, but this is not a valid comparison. A valid model comparison for models that are not nested would be AIC(model1, model2) or BIC(model1, model2), i.e. the Akaike and the Bayes Information Criterion (smaller is better).

#Visualization:
boxplot(dat$Age) #Check ?boxplot for the parameters that you can add. For example:

boxplot(dat$Age, ylim=c(0,120))
boxplot(dat$Age, col="yellow")
boxplot(dat$Age, horizontal = TRUE)

qqnorm(dat$Balance)
qqnorm(dat$Age)
qqplot(dat$Balance, dat$Age)
#qqplot() makes a two-sample Qâ€“Q plot: it compares the empirical quantiles of two numeric variables.
#So qqplot(dat$Balance, dat$Age) plots the quantiles of Balance (x-axis) against the matching quantiles of Age (y-axis).
#Use qqplot(x, y) to compare two samples; use qqnorm(x) (or qqplot(x, qnorm(ppoints(length(x))))) to compare one sample vs Normal.

#Let's say you want all variable names to start with a small letter instead of a capital letter:
colnames(dat) #Only calling a function without assignment usually does not change the values of any variable or data set. (There are exceptions, though.)
colnames(dat) <- tolower(colnames(dat))

#And now you want them all to be in capital letters:
colnames(dat) <- toupper(colnames(dat))

#And now again the fist letter capitalized and the rest small:
colnames(dat) <- paste0(toupper(substring(colnames(dat), first=1, last=1)), tolower(substring(colnames(dat), 2)))
#substring(colnames(dat), 2) is short for substring(colnames(dat), first=2, last=nchar(colnames(dat))). It takes every character starting from the second.

#String manipulation:
gsub("Y", "y", dat$Married)
#More explicit:
gsub(pattern="Y", replacement="y", x=dat$Married) #pattern = what to replace. replacement = with what to replace the pattern. x = the vector in which something should be replaced.

gsub("N", "n", dat$Married)

#Vectorized version of gsub from an addon-package:
library(kutils)
mgsub(c("Y","N"), c("y","n"), dat$Married) #Needs the addon-package kutils. If it is not installed: install.packages("kutils", dep=T); library(kutils)
