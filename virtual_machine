I uploaded a zip file containing a virtual machine (Debian 13) with R, R Markdown and LaTeX preinstalled (Debian 13+R+markdown+tinytex.7z).
It contains everything you need to run analyses and compile Rmd files to pdf.
You can find (and download) it here: https://www.swisstransfer.com/d/61cc9943-a0b4-4f6a-bb0f-90d2e5b99cad
Pros: relatively small size, low hardware requirements (RAM, storage, CPU), "no frills", you will learn a bit how to work with the console in linux.
Drawback: It is not user-friendly at all.

So I did the same again in a virtual machine based on Lubuntu 24.03.3.
Pros: Much easier to use.
Cons: Considerably larger, thus more RAM and storage required (and a faster CPU), takes longer to boot.
