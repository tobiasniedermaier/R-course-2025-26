This repository contains all the lecture slides and exercise sheets of the R course in the winter term 2025/26 for Epi students at the LMU (Group B). I will gradually add the solutions to the exercise sheets.
Some of the "extras" I added:
- Useful_links.txt (IDEs for R, where to find R packages and introductions, free LLMs)
- base-r-cheatsheet.pdf (The most commonly used R functions and their meaning)
- graph_parameters.svg (An overview of the various graphical parameters of the Base R plotting system)
- subdirectory "other_stuff":
  - good-habits-in-r-programming.pdf (The title speaks for itself.)
  - Niedermaier - Becoming a Better R Programmer.pdf (Some good practice guidance.)
  - various codes I wrote by myself over the years to get a better understanding of R not only as tool for statistical analyses but also as programming language.
  - A comparison of base R and dplyr.
  - A bootstrap tutorial.
  - And much more.

And finally, I uploaded a document "virtual_machine.txt" with a detailed instruction in how to get R and R Markdown to run in case you have any problems in doing so on your computer.
Drawback: You should at least be able to install VirtualBox and load the virtual hard drive with the preinstalled version of R. This requires considerably more resources than installing R and R Markdown directly on your computer, so it should be a "last resort" solution.

Update December 2025: Merry Christmas to y'all!
